Topic: WHO Global Health Observatory Data (GHO): Mortality, diseases, life expectancy, healthcare access]
Project Overview

 The purpose of cleaning was to prepare the data for analysis, visualization, and reporting, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and usability.

Dataset Details:

Original Dataset Name: [whosis_before_cleaning.csv]

Cleaned Dataset Name: [whosis_cleaned_data.csv]

Cleaning Process

The following steps were applied to clean the dataset:

Handling Missing Values:

Identified null or empty cells.

Dropped rows/columns only when essential or irrelevant.

Data Type Conversion:

Converted datetime columns to date where appropriate.

Ensured all numeric columns are properly typed for analysis.

Duplicate Removal:

Checked for and removed duplicate rows to ensure unique records.

Standardization:

Standardized column names, e.g., lowercase, underscores instead of spaces.

Standardized categorical values where needed (e.g., Male/Female).

Validation Checks:

Verified ranges for numeric columns.

Ensured all categorical columns contain expected values.

Usage

The cleaned dataset is ready for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical modeling or machine learning

Reporting and visualization

Notes

Some missing values remain where filling was not appropriate. These should be handled depending on your analysis needs.

All cleaning steps are documented above; refer to this README when using the dataset to understand modifications.
